## Overview

At 10up, security is our top priority. We are committed to safeguarding both our own systems and those entrusted to us by clients. To achieve this, we conduct routine Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) scans using Burp Suite. These scans are conducted by ethical hackers and experienced security professionals, enabling us to consistently identify prevalent misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that pose a risk to our client's sites.

Within this repository resides a variety of custom checks tailored specifically for Burp Suite. 10up developed these checks to target common misconfigurations and vulnerabilities frequently encountered during our daily scanning operations.
