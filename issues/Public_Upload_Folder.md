# [10up] Public upload folder

## Issue detail

Publicly accessible upload folder was identified on the website.

## Issue background

A publicly available upload folder can pose a security risk for WordPress instances for several reasons:

- **Unauthorized File Access:** When the upload folder is publicly accessible, anyone can view, download files stored there. This includes sensitive content like images, documents, and media files, as well as potentially sensitive configuration files or user data.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Personal and private data may be stored within the upload folder, such as user-uploaded images or documents. Making this data publicly available can violate user privacy and data protection regulations.
- **Information Disclosure:** Directory listings and file structure information may be exposed, making it easier for attackers to gather information about the website's structure, plugins, and themes, which can aid in crafting targeted attacks.


## Issue remediation

To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to configure WordPress correctly by limiting public access to the upload folder and ensuring that only authorized users can upload, view, and modify files within it. Proper file permissions, security plugins, and regular updates to both WordPress and its plugins and themes are essential for maintaining a secure WordPress instance.
