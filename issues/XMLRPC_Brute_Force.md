# XMLRPC Brute Force Attack

## Issue detail

 A publicly available XML-RPC interface poses a notable security risk, as it could be exploited by attackers for various malicious activities, including brute-force attacks, remote code execution, and information disclosure.

## Issue background

The XML-RPC interface in WordPress allows for remote interaction with the website, enabling functionalities such as content management and data manipulation. However, leaving this interface publicly accessible poses a security risk, as it could be exploited by malicious actors to execute unauthorized actions or launch attacks against the website. Notably, these attacks can bypass two-factor authentication (2FA).

## Issue remediation

It is recommended to restrict access to the XML-RPC interface, ensuring that it is not publicly accessible. This can be achieved by implementing access controls or firewall rules to limit access to authorized users or IP addresses only. Additionally, consider disabling or securing unnecessary XML-RPC methods to reduce the attack surface.
